Hello! Welcome to my website. 🙂

This website primarily serves as my Information Security Blog, which aims to document my cybersecurity learning journey.

Here, you'll find my write-ups for CTF problems that I have attempted, as well as cybersecurity notes that I've compiled for my own use and learning.

## About Me

📚 I was previously studying the Life Sciences, but my interest for cybersecurity and aptitude for IT led me to switch paths in the middle of my second year.

### My Interests

I have an avid interest in the field of cybersecurity.

Growing up, the one aspect of IT which has always intrigued me was malware. I recall binging hours of YouTube videos which demonstrated different types of malware, and their respective payloads.
This interest in malware thus sparked my curiosity and passion for Information Security.
