# About Me
I am a third-year Information Security Student at the National University of Singapore!

I previously pursued a degree in the Life Sciences. However, given my interest in cyber security and aptitude for IT, I opted to make the change in the middle of my second year to study my current course.

## My Interests
I have an avid interest in the fields of cyber security and computer science.

I have always been fascinated by malware and malware attacks. I hope to learn more about the theory and practice surrounding malware!

In addition, I am also interested in learning more about networking and network security!

Lastly, I've also recently developed an interest in Cloud Computing! It is my aspiration to pursue a career which deals with Cloud Infrastructure and Security!

My last internship experience was with MSD, as a Cloud FinOps Engineer/Developer.

I have experience working with Amazon Web Services, and I am familiar with some of its IaaS, PaaS and SaaS offerings.
