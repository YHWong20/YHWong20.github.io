Hello! Welcome to my website. 🙂

I created this website to document my cybersecurity learning journey. 
Here, you'll find my write-ups for some CTF problems that I have attempted, as well as other security-related material that I've learnt.

## About Me
🏫 I am a third-year Information Security Student at the National University of Singapore.

📚 I previously pursued a degree in the Life Sciences. However, given my interest in cyber security and aptitude for IT, 
I opted to make the change in the middle of my second year to study my current course.

### My Interests
💻 I have an avid interest in the fields of cyber security and computer science.

Growing up, I have always been fascinated by malware. I hope to learn more about the theory and practice surrounding malware.

🌐 In addition, I am also interested in computer networking and network security.

☁️  I've also recently developed an interest in Cloud Computing! 
I aspire to pursue a cybersecurity career which dabbles in Cloud Infrastructure/Cloud Security.

## My Experience
My latest internship experience was with MSD, as a Cloud FinOps Engineer/Developer.

Consequently, I have experience working with Amazon Web Services, and I am familiar with its IaaS, PaaS and SaaS offerings.
