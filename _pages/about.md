Hello! Welcome to my blog. 🙂

I created this blog to document my cybersecurity learning journey. 

Here, you'll find my write-ups for some CTF problems that I have attempted, as well as other security-related material that I've learnt.

## About Me
🏫 I am currently a third-year Information Security Student at the National University of Singapore.

📚 I was previously studying the Life Sciences, but my interest for cybersecurity and aptitude for IT led me to switch paths in the middle of my second year.

### My Interests
💻 I have an avid interest in the fields of cybersecurity and computer science.

Growing up, I have always been fascinated by malware, and I'm eager to learn more about the theoretical and practical aspects of malware.

🌐 Additionally, my interest extends to the fields of computer networking and network security. 

☁️ I've also recently developed an interest in Cloud Computing! 

Therefore, it is my aspiration to pursue a career in cybersecurity which melds these fields together. I would love to explore a career path with a focus on Cloud Infrastructure and Security.

## My Experience
My most recent internship experience was with MSD, as a Cloud FinOps Engineer/Developer. 

I'm currently part of the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA)'s Tech UP programme.
